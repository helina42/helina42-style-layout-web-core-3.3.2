# helina42-style-layout-web-core-3.3.2
This is a part of the layout from section 6.1, so highlight common elements based on the final layout.
Use Flexbox for layout. Employ the Mobile First approach: First, code the version for 320px, then make adjustments for other screens.
Font family: Roboto
All styles should follow the BEM methodology. The naming convention should be with two dashes: block-name__elem-name--mod-name--mod-val.
On mobile, the menu should scroll using standard horizontal scrolling, see the 'overflow' property.
Ignore variations in the order and number of menu items - the menu should be consistent across all resolutions. For unclear points in the layout, consult classmates or mentors.
In the repository name, add the name of the course and the lesson number, for example: your-project-name-web-core-3.3.2. Do the same for the other assignments.
